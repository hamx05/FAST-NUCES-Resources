- analyze passwords and tell which paswords are weak, strong, etc
- password generator that generates a strong password
-   copy button that lets u copy the passowrd
- md5 hashing for secured login
- strength bar that is updated everytime a key is entered while setting password, so it lets u see the strength of ur password visually
